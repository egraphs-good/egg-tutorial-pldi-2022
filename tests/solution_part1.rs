// This time we will try making our own language for rational arithmetic.
// This will allow us to actually interpret some of the data in the e-nodes.
// In particular, we can implement our first e-class analysis that will
// perform constant folding!

// Again, we'll just import everything from egg

// to power our rational arithmetic.

type Num = num::BigRational;

// Now we define the e-node type.
// E-nodes implement the `egg::Language` trait, and they are typically some
// pairing of a operator and a list of children (as `Id`s).
//
// The `define_language` macro makes it easy for you to make your own
// `Language`s from a Rust enum. This implements some nice parsing for you as well.
